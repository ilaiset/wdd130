        <p>Hi everyone, the educational direction I have chosen is to start with a certification in Web 
            and Computer Programming, followed by Database, then something I forgot the name of, all 
            towards my end goal in five years time - a bachelor's in Applied Technology. My current job 
            is what opened the door in my mind to this field. Otherwise, I would still be down the path 
            towards a Business Management degree. I enjoy learning, experimenting, and opening my mind to the 
            rewarding endless possibilities of technology! Business Management seems too boring to me now.</p>
        <p>What helped me decide last minute on this degree was recognizing the tech field, and the value 
            it adds to government agencies. I plan to lead the force that takes over some humans' positions. 
            Sorry, but automation is the future and I'm trying to get in as soon as possible. There are eight 
            mouths in my house to feed - five growing boys to outfit, and my only daughter to keep up with. Not to
            mention, my nieces and nephews I steal for a few days just to spoil then return back to their 
            parents. Oh yes, and I plan to adopt a german shepard for my birthday.</p>
        <p>I was born in the covenant, but chose to go down other, more dark paths in life, until recently. 
            I enrolled in BYU-Pathway last year and since then have been able to receive my patriarchal 
            blessing, endowments, accept my first ever calling in the church, and change my career choice. 
            God is good, merciful and just, and I am thankful for our Savior's Infinite Atonement that 
            blesses my life every single day.</p>
